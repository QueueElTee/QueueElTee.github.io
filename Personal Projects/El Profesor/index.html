            Sergio is highly intelligent and meticulous. He appears to be very
            determined to pull off the greatest money heists in history, after
            planning for it for several years. Once he recruits his dream team,
            he makes everyone religiously follow a strict schedule, complete
            with fundamental rules to prepare for and execute the heist. His
            perfectionist attitude is apparent through his careful consideration
            and planning for all possible scenarios that could arise during the
            heist. This forward-thinking approach helps him in his strive for
            perfection, where he urges the team to 'stick to the plan' in every
            situation.

            The Professor appears to have exceptional knowledge in negotiation
            tactics, police strategy, weaponry, law enforcement, hostage crises
            aversion, forgery, theft and bank robberies. He also demonstrates a
            deep understanding of human psychology. A majority of his plans
            gravely depend upon the reactions he predicts from the police, the
            government, and the public. This allows him to play a tense game of
            one-upmanship with Inspector Raquel Murillo, where he repeatedly
            manages to shift the status quo in favor of his team during the
            heist, despite overwhelming odds.

            His calm demeanor complements his innate leadership traits, which
            allows him to resolve team conflicts without fuss. Moreover, team
            members have great trust in his plans and decision-making ability.
            This is apparent when the team chooses to respect the protocol of
            waiting for 24 hours for his phone telephone call before activating
            'Plan Chernobyl', despite clear evidence on the television of his
            impending imprisonment a few hours before the deadline. They do this
            as they have immense respect for his intellect and believe he will
            do everything in his power to save the team from any crisis.

            Despite planning the biggest heist in human history, the Professor
            maintains stringent moral principles. He refrains from killing
            Raquel's mother even when it appears to be the only possibility of
            survival for the heist. He maintains that not spilling blood is the
            most important rule of the heist. However, it is unclear if this is
            only due to consideration of public opinion, or if it arises from a
            moral standpoint. He also shows great compassion and love for his
            team members, despite beginning his heist classes with the 'No
            Personal Relationships' rule.
